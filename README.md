# CS338
Final Project of CS338


GUI APPLICATION:

Translates English words to American Sign Language (ASL) AND Speech at the same time.

This application is a Graphical User Interface that is meant to function as an efficient translator when used by partially or fully hearing impaired people. When using this application, a partially hearing impaired individual would be able to even more efficiently comprehend the message of the original source. 

When the ‘Translate’ button is clicked, the Audio (in Speech format) will play, and a video (borrowed from handspeak.com) containing the relevant Sign Language gesture will be played simultaneously.


TO COMPILE AND RUN PROJECT:
 
Goto directory ‘project’ and run ‘make’ in the command line.
This application is in Java Swing and it works on a computer’s command line / terminal.
Make sure to have Swing installed in your computer before compiling.


PLEASE NOTE:

However, the audio (speech) does not get played when run via SFTP for some reason.
So please run it locally in a computer in a local Command Line or Terminal to hear the audio when the ‘translate’ button is pressed in the application.
